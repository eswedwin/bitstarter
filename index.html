          Real money direct into your email inbox for
          doing &quot;Nothing&quot;. Some power, automatically switched off on your
          premises, sold back to the Power Companies during a crisis or daily peak
          demand, has great value.  The Power Company does not have this power available on
          such short notice and/or it uses very expensive methods to generate it.
          This virtual power sold back to the supplier ensures net stability and thus 
          critical systems and all lights stay on. All the transactions use Bitcoin thus
          there are no transaction fees.

          HVAC systems are very good candidates for partial
          switch-off as they consume large amounts of electricity and the temperatures
          recover fast when switched back to full on. A WAN connection must available on
          the premises for most of the communication. A backup link will use the cellular
          or satellite networks. Our engineer will visit your site and do a survey of
          systems, applicability of our system to your requirement and vice-versa, and
          installation requirements. A supply contract between your company and us will
          be set up for an initial 3-year period.

          Our engineers are experts in BMS, HVAC and industrial systems and can thus
          advise you on the optimum connection. Our equipment will be installed, maintained
          on your premises by our installation technicians, and hooked up to your
          systems. The payments start immediately (settled daily) when the system is
          switched on and could be 1 to 2 percent of your electricity bill while it is
          just on standby. This increases to about 6 percent of the bill if all available
          electricity is sold, thus when 25% of your maximum demand is shed. The equipment
          monitors the total and switched load continuously and determines the energy
          switched off in a transparent way. The maximum switch off period is limited 
          to two consecutive hours in any 12-hour period with a maximum of four shed
          periods of a half hour each in the same timespan.

          <p>
          During a crisis (line trip, line overload, generator failure, etc.) the
          cloud power station comes online instantaneous (less than five seconds) to make
          up the shortfall and then keep on generating for up to 2 hours. Useful with
          tidal power or wind-generators to compensate during sudden dips in the supply.
          </p>
          <p>
          The Power Companies pay a facility fee of less than 4% of the cost of a
          similar sized new base-load generation plant over the three-year contract plus
          a steep price for the energy that is comparable to the cost for peaking-Power
          Stations. The Power Companies recover some of the money by reselling the power
          to you after the crisis or peak at a lower rate. (All envisaged loads are 
          recoverable loads.)

          <p>
          Smaller and more economical units to cover smaller clients that use mostly
          electricity for energy source.  Special design for safe, quick and easy, install and 
          maintenance on the customer premises as this is one of the major costs that do not
          scale well. Large houses use electric car chargers, electric boilers,
          under floor heating, washing machines, driers, dishwashers, etc. that are all good
          candidates for the updated units.
          </p>
          <p>
          This model is different from the smart-grid systems (and other Virtual Power
          Stations) in that the client immediately receives something substantial back
          for the inconvenience of waiting or being slightly away from the optimal temperature. 
          With smart-grid systems all the money stays with the Power Company and all the 
          inconvenience stays with the much smaller client; a typical monopoly relation!
          </p>
          <p>
          The Power Companies will fight this as it is competition for their most expensive
          power with the greatest profit.  This system also removes them from absolute control
          and restores some options to the user.

                This type of system is grid stabilizing because of its nearly instantaneous response
                to any request for extra energy. The Power Companies need less generators on
                standby/idle to continuous supply the demand and less generating plant need to
                be build and/or only the cleanest type of generator run.

                The energy generated in the grid (network) must exactly balance the sum of the energy
                losses and demand as energy cannot be destroyed or created, it just changes
                from one form to another. If the generated energy is higher, the generators all
                speed up causing the frequency and voltage of the grid to increase. When it is
                lower the frequency and voltage decreases as the generators cannot keep up and
                thus slow down. As all electric motors run at, or nearly at, the same frequency
                they also speed up or slow down causing the demand to decrease or increase. The
                runaway condition that ensues is the instability. The Power Companies mitigate
                this effect by disconnecting some generating capacity or some demand
                respectively from the grid, both undesired.

                Instead of generating more power on the grid, the same effect on grid stability can be
                attained by trimming the demand. Thus &quot;negative demand&quot; is exactly
                the same as &quot;positive supply&quot; to balance the &quot;supply =
